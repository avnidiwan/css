        <div id="inner2">
        <p>
            FOR HONEY DIP<br>
            1/4 cup honey<br>
1 tablespoon hot sauce<br>
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes<br><br><br>
            <b>INSTRUCTIONS</b><br>
            If your dough has been refrigerated, take it out of the fridge an hour before you want to make pizza.

            Divide the dough into 4 balls and let them sit at room temperature so they become easier to work with. Keep the dough covered with plastic, though, so it doesn’t dry out. (If your dough was not refrigerated, divide the dough just before shaping.)<br><br>Place a pizza stone in the preheating oven for 20 minutes so it is very hot.<br><br>Add honey to a microwave-safe bowl and heat for 10 seconds. Then stir the honey together with hot sauce and red pepper flakes. Serve the honey as a dip with any and all pizza!<br><br>On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 dough ball until it forms a 10-inch round. It should be pretty thin. Top the pizza with a few tablespoons of marinara sauce. I don’t like my pizzas very saucy, but add an extra spoon of sauce if you do.

            Then top the pizza with 4 ounces of cheese and dot on 2 ounces of spicy sausage. Be sure to tear the sausage into very tiny meatballs so they cook quickly. Season the pizza with red pepper flakes and a tiny pinch of salt and pepper.<br><br>Slide the topped pizza onto the pizza stone and cook for 8 to 10 minutes until the crust is crispy and golden brown and sausage is cooked.<br><br>While the first pizza cooks, prepare the next pizza.

<br><br>Remove the cooked pizza from the oven, and let it cool briefly. Garnish with fresh basil, slice, and serve with the hot honey dip. Repeat for cooking the remaining pizzas.
