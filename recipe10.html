            <b>INSTRUCTIONS</b><br>
            Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over medium. Add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, paprika, salt, and cumin; cook, stirring often, until the vegetables are tender, about 8 minutes.<br><br>Increase the heat to medium-high and stir in the ground beef. Cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon to crumble the meat into smaller pieces, until cooked through, about 6 minutes. If thereâ€™s a lot of fat in the pan, drain off most (but not all) of it. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, beef broth, and rice.<br><br>Bring the soup to a boil over medium-high; reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the flavors meld, about 25 minutes.<br><br>Divide the soup evenly among 6 bowls. Top evenly with cheese and garnish with parsley.

            Refrigerate leftovers for up to 4 days or freeze for up to 2 months.
